      Was the problem that I'd solved for you really finding you a virtual assistant or just taking work off your plate by way of a VA? They are two separate things.
If you truly want a VA that means you also want to take on the relationship building, the onboarding, the ongoing managing of the person. You want to feel like you have an employee (without all the downsides of having an employee).
Could it be that you just want work taken off your plate and the person that does it happens to be a VA? In this case, you still care about the person performing the work on your business and creating a relationship. However, you would love not managing anyone. You don't want to feel like you have an employee.
